Build Status: [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/crazedsanity/template.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/crazedsanity/template)

This is a templating engine, built primarily to allow easy separation between PHP and HTML.  Separating PHP from HTML helps keep the code clean and tends to avoid spaghetti code from happening.
